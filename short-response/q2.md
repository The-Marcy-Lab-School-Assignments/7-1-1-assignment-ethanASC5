# Question

What are the benefits of single-page apps (SPAs) versus multi-page apps (MPAs)?

# Answer

some benfits of single page apps vs multi page apps are faster loads on content from things like APIs, and faster timing on updating the content on the page.



# Feedback

You are correct that single page application would be faster but why is that the case. Could you go deeper as to why these proccese would be faster on a SPA vs when compared to a MPA. You are on the right track overall.
