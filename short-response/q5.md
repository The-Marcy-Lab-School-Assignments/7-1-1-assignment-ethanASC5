# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer

2 and 3 becuase when we use the :id we are using a dynamic element. This meaning the id of product can be set to whatever value we put after it. In this case it would be the number 5 and the string apple.
