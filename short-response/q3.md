# Question

When is it appropriate to use the `"*"` path for a `Route` in React Router?

# Answer

Devolpers use the "*" path when we want to handle a path that does not exist. This is for when the url doesnt make sense so the user gets redirected to a not found page.

# Feedback

The first sentence is correct, but the second sentence's wording needs to be fixed. It's not that the URL doesn't make sense, but rather that it is used as a wildcard to handle all cases that don't match a defined route in our routes.
